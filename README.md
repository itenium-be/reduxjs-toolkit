Redux Reborn
============

Embracing Modern State Management with [Redux Toolkit (RTK) v5](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

Whether you're upgrading an existing app to the officially recommended, opinionated approach for writing Redux applications or you're starting a new project and are wondering if Redux Toolkit is worth your time -- this talk is for you.

Discover how RTK v5 transforms state management by making everything type-safe, eliminating boilerplate, and simplifying your codebase. We'll explore its powerful new tools and features for creating scalable, maintainable applications with ease.

This session breaks down the core concepts of RTK, including slices, listener middleware, streamlined store setup, and the powerful `createAsyncThunk` utility. Along the way, you'll gain practical tips and strategies for migrating your existing Redux setup.

Say goodbye to boilerplate and hello to a new era of Redux development—Redux reborn!
